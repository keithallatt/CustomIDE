# CustomIDE

Custom IDE built in Python 3 and the PyQt5 module. Designed to work on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with GNOME, 
but could potentially be modified to work on other operating systems / desktop environments.

---

Currently the IDE only has a dark mode (a programmer favourite), but also currently comes with 2 themes.

As this project is still in it's early stages, a lot of the themes, color schemes, and general layout 
are likely to change.

Current Feature List
 - The ability to open, edit, and save files.
 - Python and JSON syntax highlighting.
 - A toolbar and menu bar

There are a lot of plans for the future, but until then, this project is still very much a work in progress.
